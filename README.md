Hydrogen Atom Wave Function Animation
=====================================

This repository contains a Python script for calculating and animating the wave function of a hydrogen atom in a 3D plot. It uses the `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy` libraries to perform the calculations and create the plot.

The wave function of a quantum system describes the state of the system and gives the probability distribution for the measurement of an observable. In the case of a hydrogen atom, the wave function can be written as a product of the radial and angular parts:

Œ®(r, Œ∏, œï) = R(r) Y(Œ∏, œï)

where $r$, $Œ∏$, and $œï$ are the spherical coordinates, $R(r)$ is the radial part, and $Y(Œ∏, œï)$ is the angular part of the wave function.

The wave function for a hydrogen atom in a specific state is denoted as $\Psi_{n,l,m}(r, Œ∏, œï)$, where $n$, $l$, and $m$ are the quantum numbers that specify the state.

Radial and Angular Parts of the Wave Function
--------------------------------------------

The radial part of the wave function is given by the formula:

R<sub>n,l</sub>(r) = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{2}{n a_0} \right)^3 \frac{(n-l-1)!}{2n[(n+l)!]^3} } e^{-\frac{r}{na_0}} \left( \frac{2r}{na_0} \right)^l L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1} \left( \frac{2r}{na_0} \right)

where $n$ is the principal quantum number, $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $a_0$ is the Bohr radius, and $L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1}$ is the associated Laguerre polynomial.

The angular part of the wave function is given by the spherical harmonic functions:

Y<sub>l,m</sub>(Œ∏, œï) = (-1)^m \sqrt{ \frac{2l+1}{4\pi} \frac{(l-m)!}{(l+m)!} } P_l^m(\cos(Œ∏)) e^{i m \phi}

where $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $m$ is the magnetic quantum number, $Œ∏$ is the polar angle, $œï$ is the azimuthal angle, and $P_l^m$ is the associated Legendre polynomial.

Calculating the Wave Function and Probability Density
-------------------------------------------------------

The `compute_wave_function` function computes the wave function for a given set of quantum numbers $n$, $l$, and $m$ and a scale factor for the Bohr radius. It then calculates the probability density using the `compute_probability_density` function.

Plotting the Wave Function
--------------------------

The `plot_wave_function` function plots the probability density using `matplotlib`'s `imshow` function, which creates a 2D image of the 3D probability density. The `update` function is an animation function that updates the plot at each frame by computing the wave function and probability density for a given set of quantum numbers and a scale factor for the Bohr radius.

Running the Script
------------------

To run the script, simply execute the `main` function in a Python environment. The script will display a 3D plot of the wave function and probability density for the given set of quantum numbers and the Bohr radius scale factor. The plot will be animated with a time-dependent wave function.

The script includes the Bohr radius value from the `physical_constants` module of the `scipy` library. The `genlaguerre` and `lpmv` functions from the `scipy` library are used to calculate the associated Laguerre and Legendre polynomials, respectively. The `imshow` function from the `matplotlib` library is used to create the 2D image of the 3D probability density.

Here is the wave function in LaTeX:

ùúì<sub>n,l,m</sub

(r, Œ∏, œï) = R<sub>n,l</sub>

(r) Y<sub>l,m</sub>

(Œ∏, œï)

Where $R_{n,l}(r)$ is the radial part of the wave function and $Y_{l,m}(Œ∏, œï)$ is the angular part of the wave function.

The wave function can also be written as:

ùúì<sub>n,l,m</sub>

(r, Œ∏, œï) = ùëÖ<sub>n,l</sub>

(r) P<sub>l</sub><sup>m</sup>

(Œ∏) e^(im œï)

Where $P_l^m(Œ∏)$ is the associated Legendre polynomial and $e^{im œï}$ is the complex exponential function.
